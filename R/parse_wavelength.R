#' Correspondence table between wavelengths of visible light and sRGB colors
#'
#' @format A data.frame with 77 rows and 2 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{wl}{the wavelength, in nm.}
#'   \item{color}{the hex code of the corresponding color.}
#' }
#' @details As explained by the author, David Eccles: "Colour ranges were taken from 'CRC Handbook of Fundamental Spectroscopic Correlation Charts' (see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum}). Spectral XYZ locus coordinates were found at \url{http://www.cie.co.at/main/freepubs.html}. Every 10nm, the spectral locus point was used as the initial point in a search for a matching sRGB colour (assuming "Dim" viewing condition). The search was carried out by a binary search along a line in JCh space between the spectral point, and a point with 0.3 * brightness (J), 0 chroma (C), and the same hue (h) as the spectral point. The search finished when a point was found that was in sRGB space. The CAT02 matrix was modified as suggested in Brill(2008) \url{https://doi.org/10.1002/col.20432} to reduce yellow-blue problems by replacing the bottom row (0.0030, 0.0136, 0.9834) with (0,0,1). An iterative smoothing was carried out to eliminate the largest jumps in chroma (greater than 5\% change). Code used to generate the colour gradient can be found at \url{http://www.gringene.org/code/spectrum.r}."

#' Color specification as wavelength

#' Convert colors specified as the wavelength of a beam of monochromatic light into an R color.

#' @param x vector of wavelengths.

#' @details The human eye can distinguish colors between approximately 380 and 750 nm. The colors that we name (arbitrarily, since they really change continuously along the spectrum) are: Violet = [380,450] nm, Blue = [450,495] nm, Green = [495,570] nm, Yellow = [570,590] nm, Orange = [590,620] nm, Red = [620,750] nm.
#'
#' The correspondance with colors in sRGB-space (the ones R can use) is only approximate because not all monochromatic light colors can be accurately represented in sRGB. Technically it is done by interpolating from a lookup table, described in \code{\link{visible}}, which itself is a numerical approximation of the match between input colours and sRGB equivalents.
